# Data-Sampling-and-Visualization

This is my 2nd lab for my ECE 16 class (Rapid hardware and software design for interfacing with the world)

The goal of this lab is to introduce you to microcontroller based strategies for data sampling and Python based methods for data analysis.  You will consider different strategies for data acquisition and communication to the PC, run experiments to test these strategies, and analyze/visualize the data from the experiments.  The main consideration we will make in this laboratory is timing stability and communications.

Objective One - Implement sampling

Objective Two - Implement interrupt based sampling

Objective Three - Log data to a file

Objective Four - Summarize Performance

Objective Five - Maximum Sampling Rate & Baud Rate

Objective Six - From ASCII to Binary
